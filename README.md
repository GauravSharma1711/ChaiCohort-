<h1>Git & GitHub Guide for Chai Cohort Members ðŸš€<h1/>
<h2>Introduction<h2/>

Welcome to the one-stop solution for learning Git & GitHub! This guide is specially designed for members of the Chai Cohort in a beginner-friendly manner. Here, youâ€™ll not only learn Git & GitHub from basics to advanced but also see real-life examples to make your understanding easier. Letâ€™s dive in! ðŸ˜Š

<h2>Problem Statement<h2/>
Imagine this:

Your company, Chai Cohort, is hosting a mini-hackathon with exciting gifts for the winners! ðŸŽ‰ Youâ€™re eager to participate but there's a catch â€“ itâ€™s a full-stack web development hackathon, and you only know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic React.

To solve this, you leverage the alumni network and form a team with a beginner backend developer, Gaurav. Everything seems great, exceptâ€¦

ðŸ’” The Problem: You and Gaurav live in different cities. How will you both collaborate on the same codebase?

Gaurav comes to the rescue:
<Br>
"We can use a centralized codebase to share and update our code."

The solution? Git & GitHub.

<h2>What is Git?<h2/>

Git is a version control system (VCS) that tracks changes in your code and helps you collaborate with others. Itâ€™s like a time machine for your code.

With Git, you can:

Save Snapshots: Capture the state of your code at different points (called commits).

Undo Mistakes: Revert to an earlier version if something breaks.

Collaborate: Work with multiple developers on the same project without conflicts.

Think of Git as software running on your computer to manage your project files.


<h2>What is GitHub?</h2h2>

GitHub is an online platform that hosts your Git repositories. Itâ€™s like Google Drive but specifically for code.

With GitHub, you can:

Backup Code: Save your code in the cloud for safekeeping.

Collaborate: Work with others on the same project.

Track Changes: View the history of edits and contributions.

Learn and Share: Discover open-source projects or share your own

<h2>Installation and Setup:<h2/>
  
1. Install Git

Download Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
![git-scm com_downloads](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2be67d7f-a029-472a-b693-ef638cb82863)

After installation, open a terminal and type:

```bash
git --version

```
This checks if Git is installed correctly.

<br>
<img width="943" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8840b544-99b1-4593-b5cf-310e2110cab4" />
Hurray! ðŸŽ‰ Your repo has been created! ðŸš€



<h1>Cloning the ChaiCode Repository:<h1/>
Now firstly create a folder(chaicohort) in your system and open it in your codeEditor
<img width="959" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d142573-719f-44ff-8fb5-c903f5fae891" />
  <br>
  No code editor? No worries, weâ€™ve got you covered! ðŸš€ðŸ’»
  <br>
To install Visual Studio Code (VS Code), follow the steps
Go to(https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
<img width="936" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62c5eb0c-00a7-4677-90e6-7e874f77edee" />
Download based on your operating system:

Now,
to clone your repository present in your Githuhub account to your local machine
<img width="931" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c770f87f-1dd4-471b-89f1-97961e1aad86" />
<br>
click on code
<br>
<img width="799" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33cf52e0-d1c6-4366-819a-b54fe9ac92ac" />
<br>
copy this link
<br>
Now open terminal in your code editor and write command
```
git clone <repository-url>

```
<img width="718" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/244258f7-788c-4fbd-92f7-f48eaf902fb3" />

Hurray! ðŸŽ‰ Your chaicode repository has been cloned from your Github account to your local machine! ðŸš€

<h1>Basic Git Commands:<h1/>

```
git status
```
<img width="584" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4d7a57d-9216-41f1-93b3-7b0c4e507c3e" />
<br>
here cd means change directory i.e now i m inside chaiCode folder
<br>
status command displays the state of code
<br>
2.Git add command
```
git add <filename>
```
The git add command stages changes in your working directory, preparing them to be committed to the local repository.
<img width="902" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-10 232623" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/533cfeec-bee1-4f63-80f1-3ebaa5f5a915" />
<img width="653" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4049dd5-0047-4ae2-8365-4a035f29e844" />
<br>
Now the file test.txt is tracked by git and is ready to commit
<br>
3. commit command
```
git commit -m "some message"
```

The git commit command is used to save the staged changes to the local repository, creating a snapshot of your project at that point in time.
<br>
<img width="689" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff7a742d-08b2-4348-8b02-da486c2e840b" />
<br>
4.Push command
The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
```
git push origin main
```

<br>

6.Git pull
```
git pull <remote> <branch>
git pull origin main
```
The git pull command is used to fetch and integrate changes from a remote repository into your local repository
<br>

### Commit Message Rules

To ensure meaningful and standardized commit messages, follow these rules:

#### 1. **Use Present Tense**
   - Always use the present tense to describe your changes.
   - **Example**: `Add new user authentication feature` (not `Added new user authentication feature`).

#### 2. **Capitalize the First Letter**
   - Start your commit message with a capital letter.
   - **Example**: `Fix typo in login form` (not `fix typo in login form`).

#### 3. **Keep It Short and Concise**
   - Keep the commit message **50 characters or fewer** for the **subject line**. It should be a brief summary of the change.
   - If necessary, add a detailed explanation in the body (after a blank line), but **avoid long descriptions in the subject**.
   - **Example**: `Fix login issue with invalid credentials`.

#### 4. **Use Prefixes for Categorization**
   - Use standardized prefixes to categorize the nature of the commit. Common prefixes include:
     - `fix:` â€“ For bug fixes.
     - `feat:` â€“ For new features.
     - `docs:` â€“ For documentation changes.
     - `chore:` â€“ For routine tasks, such as refactoring or maintenance.
     - `style:` â€“ For formatting changes (e.g., code style).
     - `test:` â€“ For adding or modifying tests.
   
   - **Examples**:
     - `feat: Add user registration page`
     - `fix: Resolve issue with form validation`
     - `docs: Update README with setup instructions`
     - `chore: Refactor authentication module`

#### 5. **Provide Context**
   - If necessary, provide **context** for why the change is being made, especially for larger or more complex changes. If the commit is not self-explanatory, add a detailed explanation in the body of the message.
   
   - **Example**:
     ```plaintext
     feat: Add social login options

     Added Google and Facebook login options to improve user onboarding experience.
     ```
   
#### 6. **Avoid Redundancy**
   - Don't repeat the same information. For example, donâ€™t start the message with "Update" or "Fix," as these are implied by the context.
   - **Bad**: `Update the login page`
   - **Good**: `Fix login page display issue`

#### 7. **Reference Issues or Pull Requests**
   - If your commit relates to an open issue or pull request, reference it in the commit message (e.g., `Fixes #123` or `Closes #45`).
   - **Example**: `fix: Correct user permissions logic (Closes #123)`

<h1>Branching<h1/>
<br>
Git branching allows you to create separate lines of development for different features, bug fixes, or experiments, without affecting the main codebase.

1 git branch
To check branch
```
git branch
```
<img width="557" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f84058b8-18b7-42d9-9f66-0c60b5052726" />

<br>

2 To create new branch
```
git checkout -b <new branch name>
```
<img width="659" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ff21e5f-bb10-4db0-bbc3-8d529067a462" />

<br>

3 to delete branch
```
git branch -d <branch name>
```
<img width="658" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46d1e993-f934-409e-b3d7-dffdc566eb47" />

<br>

<br>
4. Merge Code
<br>
