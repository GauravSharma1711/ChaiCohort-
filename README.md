<h1>Git & GitHub Guide for Chai Cohort Members ðŸš€<h1/>
<h2>Introduction<h2/>

Welcome to the one-stop solution for learning Git & GitHub! This guide is specially designed for members of the Chai Cohort in a beginner-friendly manner. Here, youâ€™ll not only learn Git & GitHub from basics to advanced but also see real-life examples to make your understanding easier. Letâ€™s dive in! ðŸ˜Š

<h2>Problem Statement<h2/>
Imagine this:

Your company, Chai Cohort, is hosting a mini-hackathon with exciting gifts for the winners! ðŸŽ‰ Youâ€™re eager to participate but there's a catch â€“ itâ€™s a full-stack web development hackathon, and you only know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic React.

To solve this, you leverage the alumni network and form a team with a beginner backend developer, Gaurav. Everything seems great, exceptâ€¦

ðŸ’” The Problem: You and Gaurav live in different cities. How will you both collaborate on the same codebase?

Gaurav comes to the rescue:
<Br>
"We can use a centralized codebase to share and update our code."

The solution? Git & GitHub.

<h2>What is Git?<h2/>

Git is a version control system (VCS) that tracks changes in your code and helps you collaborate with others. Itâ€™s like a time machine for your code.

With Git, you can:

Save Snapshots: Capture the state of your code at different points (called commits).

Undo Mistakes: Revert to an earlier version if something breaks.

Collaborate: Work with multiple developers on the same project without conflicts.

Think of Git as software running on your computer to manage your project files.

<h2>What is GitHub?</h2h2>

GitHub is an online platform that hosts your Git repositories. Itâ€™s like Google Drive but specifically for code.

With GitHub, you can:

Backup Code: Save your code in the cloud for safekeeping.

Collaborate: Work with others on the same project.

Track Changes: View the history of edits and contributions.

Learn and Share: Discover open-source projects or share your own
